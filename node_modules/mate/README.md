# Mate

On both browser and node.js, Mate brings these features:

- Promise-style HTTP request: GET, POST, or custom methods
- A new way of handling events
- Array extensions: max, min, group, sum, average, ...
- Advanced timers
- Observer: useful for data binding
- Functional functions
- 2D point, complex number, complex math
- Super natural testing

It extends the native JavaScript/CoffeeScript, and works consistently in every modern web browser and node.js.
